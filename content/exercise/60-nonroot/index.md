### Introduction
In this exercise, we cover:

 - How user identities work in Kubernetes
 - How to use a non-root user ID and enforce this in the future

We will show how running as root:

 - Is the default behavior
 - Lets you modify host files if mounted
 - Allows other host modifications
 - Still blocks other host modifications due to other controls
   (more on this in the following exercise)

Note that almost all clusters run without username remapping,
so generally the `root` user in the container is the same as the `root` user on the host.

### Setup
For simplicity, we'll use a shell directly in this case.

Before we deploy, let's see what this app does.
Use the Cloud Shell Editor, or open the code your terminal:

```
less static/simple-server/main.go
```

{{< embedCodeFile file="/static/simple-server/main.go" language="go" >}}

```
less static/simple-server/Dockerfile
```

{{< embedCodeFile file="/static/simple-server/Dockerfile" language="docker" >}}

Let's get deployed:

```
kubectl apply -f https://securek8s.dev/simple-server/app.yaml
```

### "Attack"
Let's find a pod:

```
kubectl get po -n nonroot
```

And exec into it:
```
kubectl exec -it -n nonroot $(kubectl get po -n nonroot --output=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') sh
```

_Note:_ We're using `sh` now because this is an Alpine image.

Check who you are:
```
whoami
```

Then, we can do a variety of things to the host, because we're running as root:
```
echo "169.254.169.254 example.com" >> /host/etc/hosts
cat /host/etc/hosts
```

Can you think of anything else?

Hit `Ctrl-D` to exit the pod.

### Countermeasure
First, we'll set `runAsNonRoot` in the pod's `securityContext`.
This will prevent anyone from accidentally running a container as root.

See the diff:
```
kubectl diff -f https://securek8s.dev/simple-server/app-not-allowed.yaml
```

Note that we haven't bumped the image to _actually_ use a non-root userâ€”a common mistake.

Then, roll out the change:
```
kubectl apply -f https://securek8s.dev/simple-server/app-not-allowed.yaml
```

You'll see that the pods are failing to create:
```
kubectl get pod -n nonroot
```

You'll see a status `CreateContainerConfigError`.

If you `kubectl describe -n nonroot <your-pod-name>`, you'll see an error `Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root`.
Since the new container can't launch successfully, Kubernetes has left the old pod active still.

Next, we'll change to an image that's _actually_ been prepared to run as non-root.
We'll see how this can still be exposed on the same port using a Service, even though thee container has switched from 80 to 8080.

See the diff in the Dockerfile:
```
diff static/simple-server/Dockerfile static/simple-server/Dockerfile-nonroot
```

{{< embedCodeFile file="/static/simple-server/nonroot.patch" language="patch" >}}

...and in the YAML:
```
kubectl diff -f https://securek8s.dev/simple-server/app-nonroot.yaml
```

Then, roll out the change:
```
kubectl apply -f https://securek8s.dev/simple-server/app-nonroot.yaml
```

Our change successfully rolls out:
```
kubectl get pod -n nonroot -w
```

You're ready to move on when your new pod (with a smaller `AGE` value) is `Running`,
and the older pod is `Terminating`.

Then, you can continue trying to execute commands in the containers:
```
kubectl exec -it -n nonroot $(kubectl get po -n nonroot --output=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') sh
```

Perhaps try adding new code:
```
apk update
apk add curl
```

### Attack effects after patching
Once we successfully run as a non-root user, we are a bit more constrained in what we can do to the host. If we repeat our attempts to modify `/host/etc` we will fail.

### How to use it yourself
In most cases, you'll need at least a simple modification to your `Dockerfile` to set the non-root user ID.
In some cases, the app may need more substantial changes.

You can set the `runAsNonRoot` flag in your pod spec to prevent accidentally running as root.

You can also require `runAsNonRoot` using admission control.

"a container where the semantics for id 0 are the same inside and outside of the container ceteris paribus"--
this is not the same as the `--privileged` option in Docker.
